In July 2014, UC Berkeley was awarded a four-year grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. With the goal of "Capacity Building and Integration", a new partnership between [Research IT](research-it.berkeley.edu) and the Dean of Arts and Humanities set out to better support existing projects and foster new digital humanities research and pedagogy. As hire #3 of this budding program, my role evolved to meet the program's various needs in communications, community outreach, training, curriculum development, and course support.

## What is/are the digital humanities? 
The digital humanities encompass disciplines such as history, literature, new media, Near Eastern studies, music, art history, art practice, and more. Researchers use a variety of tools and techniques, such as natural language processing, geospatial analysis, network analysis, data visualization, and 3D modeling. 

## Blogging
The [DH at Berkeley blog](http://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/blog) featured interviews and guest posts by students, professors, and staff members from around campus. During my time as editor and main contributor, the blog explored questions such as: How does DH research facilitate new opportunities for collaboration? What new research questions and concerns do these technologies raise? How do humanities scholars approach training and joining a community of practice?
