### TL;DR
Full-stack web developer excited about interdisciplinary collaboration, open source software, and facilitating supportive team environments.

### Hi. I'm Camille. I'm a/n...

#### software developer
I recently graduated from Dev Bootcamp and am seeking opportunities to keep learning and growing. I focus on building beautiful and deployable projects with extensible data structures and sensible user interfaces. Explore [my projects](/portfolio) and [ongoing work on GitHub](https://github.com/camillevilla).

#### digital humanist
I love the thoughtful, critical work that lives at the intersection of humanistic inquiry, art, computation, and other digital tools. As hire #3 of the [Digital Humanities at Berkeley](http://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu) program, I facilitated communities of practice, supported curriculum development, provided technical consulting, and worked with professors and graduate students to develop projects and grant proposals.

#### open knowledge advocate
I like digging into research and empowering others to do the same. I used to teach [a class on research skills, archives, libraries, and databases](http://historicalresearchworkshop.com/?page_id=2). I draw inspiration from movements around open access publishing, open culture, and open source software.

I’m interested in what it means to be “technical” in various fields. Building alternative routes for people to get there and gathering communities to support them is an ongoing passion of mine.
