A mobile-first app for taking the hassle out of group travel logistics. Tie-In brings friendsâ€™ itineraries, accommodations, and events together in one smooth experience. Spend less time coordinating and more time connecting! Team project built in an 8 day sprint. Built with Ruby on Rails, jQuery, PostgreSQL, D3.js, Google Maps, Bootstrap, and Masonry. I specialized in Rails and implementing our project's back-end. As PM, I focused on clean Git workflow and implementing a testing suite with RSpec and Travis CI.
